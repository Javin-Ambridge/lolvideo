# ProLeagueVideos Frontend

This is a side project I have been working on for the past few months, it is available at: www.proleaguevideos.com.

Essentially this is a website that allows people who enjoy watching professional league of legends to vote on their favourite games, and watch games that other people have thought were good games. Essentially allowing everyone to find good content to watch.
